#Intern and Placement Office (IPO) Management System
Overview:
The Intern and Placement Office (IPO) Management System is designed to facilitate the internship placement process for BSSE 4th-year students at IIT. The system manages interactions between the IPO Committee (IPOC), students, and companies offering internships. It ensures a streamlined workflow from company enlistment, student application, and interview scheduling, to final selection and offer letter issuance.

Features:
Company Management: The IPO head can enlist new companies. IPOC members can enter and store company details, available positions, job responsibilities, and HR contact information.
Student Management: Students upload their CVs, and list their skillsets, CGPA, and company preferences.
Placement Allocation: IPOC members suggest student lists to the IPO head based on company requirements. The IPO head allocates students to companies for interviews.
Interview Scheduling: Admit cards with specific interview dates and times are generated and displayed on student dashboards.
Status Tracking: Both students and IPOC members can track the status of each stage in the placement process.
Selection and Notification: Companies update the system with the selection results. Automated emails notify students of their status.
Formal Documentation: Generate and email formal selection letters to company HR and IPOC officers. Offer letters from companies are preserved by the IPO head.
